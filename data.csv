The net metering dead end,"LET’S start with putting a couple of undue misapprehensions to rest. I have had the opportunity of interacting with key decision-makers in the power bureaucracy and they assure me of two things.

They emphasise that changes are being considered in the net metering regulations of 2015, with a view to reducing the amount people receive for the power their systems pump into the grid, but that those with existing systems will not be impacted."

A fresh approach?,"SUCCESSIVE governments have tried to address the problems of Balochistan — particularly the province’s precarious law and order situation — with very little success. On Tuesday, President Asif Zardari, during a visit to Quetta, made a fresh attempt to tackle the issues of this tortured land. The president, while presiding over a meeting with top federal and provincial officials, reiterated the need for ‘dialogue’ between all political forces in Balochistan, while also calling for efforts to address its socioeconomic and law and order issues. A similar attempt was made by Mr Zardari and his party the last time he was in the presidency through the 2009 Aghaz-i-Haqooq-i-Balochistan package which was, at least on paper, a thorough plan designed to deal with many of the issues that have contributed to alienation in Balochistan. But today, nearly 15 years after the package was announced, separatist violence continues in Balochistan, as the underlying discontent has not been addressed. Other elected governments thereafter also announced various packages and schemes for the province, yet Balochistan’s problems remain unresolved."
Visa fraud,"THE FIA has a new task at hand: cracking down on fraudulent work visas. This was prompted by the discovery of a Pakistani human smugglingnetwork in Romania, which arranged for migrants to enter the EU through such means. The smugglers not only facilitated illegal entry into the EU but also the migrants’ further clandestine movement towards more affluent European nations, exploiting their hopes for a better life. The criminal network requested 509 work permits, successfully acquiring 102, and generating illicit profits exceeding a million euros. The FIA is broadening its focus from traditional sea and land routes to include air routes through Central Asia. Smugglers now use these air pathways alongside the earlier routes from Quetta through Iran, Turkey, and Greece, charging exorbitant rates to transport individuals into Europe. The urgency to address this menace has never been clearer. The government recently organised a conference in Islamabad in collaboration with international bodies to discuss human smuggling. However, this initiative must be part of a broader, more comprehensive strategy to tackle the issue."
